# Rule ID: RHEL-06-000510_rule
# Severity: medium
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): RHEL-06-000510
# Rule Title: The audit system must take appropriate action when the 
# audit storage volume is full.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: Taking appropriate action in case of a filled 
# audit storage volume will minimize the possibility of losing audit 
# records.
#
# Responsibility: 
# IAControls: 
#
# Check Content:
#
# Inspect "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" and locate the following line to 
# determine if the system is configured to take appropriate action when the 
# audit storage volume is full:

# grep disk_full_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
# disk_full_action = [ACTION]


# If the system is configured to "suspend" when the volume is full or 
# "ignore" that it is full, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: 
#
# The "auditd" service can be configured to take an action when disk 
# space starts to run low. Edit the file "/etc/audit/auditd.conf". Modify 
# the following line, substituting [ACTION] appropriately: 

# disk_full_action = [ACTION]

# Possible values for [ACTION] are described in the "auditd.conf" man page. 
# These include: 

# "ignore"
# "syslog"
# "exec"
# "suspend"
# "single"
# "halt"


# Set this to "syslog", "exec", "single", or "halt".

#
#So the breakdown is this:
#Suspend with suspend the system (bad if this is an Amazon image or something)
#Single will put the system into single usermode (bad again if AMI)
#Halt will halt the system (bad again)
#exec will execute a command (Thats ok..just don't know what everyone would want it to be)
##If for some reason in the future syslog wasn't allowed, we could do exec + the logger 
##command and get the same result *giggles*.  We could also push to WALL and notify everyone thats
##actually on the System.
#
#So were going to assume that people followed the STIG guidance and configured a syslog
#server (and actually watch the logs) HA!
