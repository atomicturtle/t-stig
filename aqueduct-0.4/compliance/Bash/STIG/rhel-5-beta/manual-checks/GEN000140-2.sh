#Group ID (Vulid): V-11941-2
#Group Title: System Baseline Must Contain Cryptographic Hashes
#Rule ID: SV-12442-2r6_rule
#Severity: CAT II
#Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN000140-2
#Rule Title: A file integrity baseline including cryptographic hashes 
#must be created and maintained.
#
#Vulnerability Discussion: A file integrity baseline is a collection 
#of file metadata which is to evaluate the integrity of the system. 
#A minimal baseline must contain metadata for all device files, 
#setuid files, setgid files, system libraries, system binaries, and 
#system configuration files. The minimal metadata must consist of 
#the mode, owner, group owner, and modification times. For regular 
#files, metadata must also include file size and a cryptographic 
#hash of the fileâ€™s contents.
#
#Responsibility: System Administrator
#IAControls: DCSW-1
#
#Check Content: 
#Determine if a file integrity baseline, which includes 
#cryptographic hashes, has been created for the system.
#
#Procedure:
#
#If the file integrity baseline contains no cryptographic hashes, 
#this is a finding.
#
#
#
#Fix Text: Create a file integrity baseline, including cryptographic 
#hashes, for the system.
