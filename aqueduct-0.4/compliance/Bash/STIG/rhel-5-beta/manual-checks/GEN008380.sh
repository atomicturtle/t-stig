#Group ID (Vulid): V-22575
#Group Title: GEN008380
#Rule ID: SV-26250r1_rule
#Severity: CAT II
#Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN008380
#Rule Title: A root kit check tool must be run on the system at least weekly.
#
#Vulnerability Discussion: Root kits are software packages designed to
#conceal the compromise of a system from the SA. Root kit checking
#tools examine a system for evidence that a root kit is installed.
#Dedicated root kit detection software or root kit detection
#capabilities included in anti-virus packages may be used to
#satisfy this requirement.
#
#Responsibility: System Administrator
#IAControls: DCSL-1
#
#Check Content: 
#Ask the SA if a root kit check tool is run on the system weekly. 
#If this is not performed, this is a finding.
#
#Fix Text: Create an automated job or establish a site-defined procedure 
#to check the system weekly with a root kit check tool.
