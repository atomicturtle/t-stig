#Group ID (Vulid): V-11941-3
#Group Title: Maintain System Baseline
#Rule ID: SV-12442-3r1_rule
#Severity: CAT II
#Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN000140-3
#Rule Title: A file integrity baseline maintained.
#
#Vulnerability Discussion: A file integrity baseline is a collection 
#of file metadata which is to evaluate the integrity of the system. A 
#minimal baseline must contain metadata for all device files, setuid 
#files, setgid files, system libraries, system binaries, and system 
#configuration files. The minimal metadata must consist of the mode, 
#owner, group owner, and modification times. For regular files, 
#metadata must also include file size and a cryptographic hash of 
#the fileâ€™s contents.
#
#Responsibility: System Administrator
#IAControls: DCSW-1
#
#Check Content: 
#Determine if a file integrity baseline, which includes cryptographic 
#hashes, has been maintained for the system.
#
#Procedure:
#If the file integrity baseline is not maintained (that is, the 
#baseline has not been updated to be consistent with the latest 
#approved system configuration changes), this is a finding.
#
#Fix Text: Rebuild the integrity baseline, including cryptographic 
#hashes, for the system to be consistent with the latest approved 
#system configuration.   _
