#Group ID (Vulid): V-22375
#Group Title: GEN002730
#Rule ID: SV-26518r1_rule
#Severity: CAT II
#Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN002730
#Rule Title: The audit system must alert the SA when the audit storage 
#volume approaches its capacity.
#
#Vulnerability Discussion: An accurate and current audit trail is 
#essential for maintaining a record of system activity. If the system 
#fails, the SA must be notified and must take prompt action to correct 
#the problem.
#
#Minimally, the system must log this event and the SA will receive 
#this notification during the daily system log review. If feasible, 
#active alerting (such as e-mail or paging) should be employed 
#consistent with the siteâ€™s established operations management 
#systems and procedures.
#
#Responsibility: System Administrator
#IAControls: ECAT-1
#
#Check Content: 
#Check /etc/auditd.conf for the space_left_action and 
#action_mail_account parameters. If the space_left_action 
#parameter is missing or set to "ignore", this is a finding. 
#If the space_left_action is set to "email" and the action_mail_account 
#parameter is not set to the e-mail address of the system 
#administrator, this is a finding.
#
#Fix Text: Edit /etc/auditd.conf and set the space_left_action 
#parameter to a valid setting other than "ignore". If the 
#space_left_action parameter is set to "email" set the 
#action_email_account parameter to an e-mail address for 
#the system administrator.
