#Group ID (Vulid): V-785
#Group Title: Unowned Files
#Rule ID: SV-785r6_rule
#Severity: CAT II
#Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN001160
#Rule Title: All files and directories must have a valid owner.
#
#Vulnerability Discussion: Unowned files and directories may be 
#unintentionally inherited if a user is assigned the same UID as the 
#UID of the unowned files.
#
#Responsibility: System Administrator
#IAControls: ECCD-1, ECCD-2
#
#Check Content: 
#Check the system for files with no assigned owner.
#
#Procedure:
# find / -nouser
#
#If any files have no assigned owner, this is a finding.
#
#
#
#Fix Text: All directories and files (executable and data) will have 
#an identifiable owner and group name. Either trace files to an 
#authorized user, change the fileâ€™s owner to root, or delete them. 
#Determine the legitimate owner of the files and use the chown command 
#to set the owner and group to the correct value. If the legitimate 
#owner cannot be determined, change the owner to root (but make sure 
#none of the changed files remain executable because they could be 
#Trojan horses or other malicious code). Examine the files to determine 
#their origin and the reason for their lack of an owner/group.
