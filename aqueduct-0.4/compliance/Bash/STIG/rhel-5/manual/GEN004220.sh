# Group ID (Vulid): V-4382
# Group Title: GEN004220
# Rule ID: SV-37469r1_rule
# Severity: high
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN004220
# Rule Title: Administrative accounts must not run a web browser, except 
# as needed for local service administration.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: If a web browser flaw is exploited while 
# running as a privileged user, the entire system could be compromised.

# Specific exceptions for local service administration should be documented 
# in site-defined policy.  These exceptions may include HTTP(S)-based tools 
# used for the administration of the local system, services, or attached 
# devices.  Examples of possible exceptions are HPâ€™s System Management 
# Homepage (SMH), the CUPS administrative interface, and Sun's StorageTek 
# Common Array Manager (CAM) when these services are running on the local 
# system.
#
# Responsibility: System Administrator
# IAControls: ECLP-1
#
# Check Content:
#
# Look in the root account home directory for a .mozilla directory. If 
# none exists, this is not a finding. If there is one, verify with the root 
# users and the IAO the intent of the browsing.  If the browsing is not 
# limited to authorized local services administration, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: 
#
# Enforce policy requiring administrative accounts use web browsers only 
# for local service administration.
