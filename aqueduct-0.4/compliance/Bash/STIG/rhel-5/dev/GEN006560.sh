# Group ID (Vulid): V-12028
# Group Title: GEN006560
# Rule ID: SV-37747r1_rule
# Severity: medium
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN006560
# Rule Title: The system vulnerability assessment tool, host-based 
# intrusion detection tool, and file integrity tool must notify the SA and 
# the IAO of a security breach or a suspected security breach.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: Timely notifications of potential security 
# compromises minimize the potential damage.

# Minimally, the system must log these events and the SA and the IAO will 
# receive the notifications during the daily system log review.  If 
# feasible, active alerting (such as e-mail or paging) should be employed 
# consistent with the siteâ€™s established operations management systems and 
# procedures.
#
# Responsibility: System Administrator
# IAControls: ECAT-1, ECAT-2
#
# Check Content:
#
# For each security tool on the system, determine if the tool is 
# configured to notify the IAO and SA of any detected security problem. If 
# such notifications are not configured, this is a finding.


#
# Fix Text: 
#
# Configure the security tools on the system to notify the IAO and SA 
# when any security issues are detected.
