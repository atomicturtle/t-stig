# Group ID (Vulid): V-22374
# Group Title: GEN002719
# Rule ID: SV-26517r1_rule
# Severity: low
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN002719
# Rule Title: The audit system must alert the SA in the event of an audit 
# processing failure.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: An accurate and current audit trail is 
# essential for maintaining a record of system activity.  If the system 
# fails, the SA must be notified and must take prompt action to correct the 
# problem.

# Minimally, the system must log this event and the SA will receive this 
# notification during the daily system log review.  If feasible, active 
# alerting (such as e-mail or paging) should be employed consistent with 
# the siteâ€™s established operations management systems and procedures.
#
# Responsibility: System Administrator
# IAControls: ECAT-1
#
# Check Content:
#
# Verify the /etc/audit/auditd.conf has the disk_full_action and 
# disk_error_action parameters set.

# Procedure:
# grep disk_full_action /etc/audit/audit.conf

# If the disk_full_action parameter is missing or set to "suspend" or 
# "ignore" this is a finding.

# grep disk_error_action /etc/audit/audit.conf

# If the disk_error_action parameter is missing or set to "suspend" or 
# "ignore" this is a finding.

#
# Fix Text: 
#
# Edit /etc/audit/auditd.conf and set the disk_full_action and/or 
# disk_error_action parameters to a valid setting of "syslog", "exec", 
# "single" or "halt", adding the parameters if necessary.

#So the breakdown is this:
#Suspend with suspend the system (bad if this is an Amazon image or something)
#Single will put the system into single usermode (bad again if AMI)
#Halt will halt the system (bad again)
#exec will execute a command (Thats ok..just don't know what everyone would want it to be)
#So were going to assume that people followed the STIG guidance and configured a syslog server (and actually watch the logs)
