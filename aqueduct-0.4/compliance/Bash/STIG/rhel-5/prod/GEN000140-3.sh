# Group ID (Vulid): V-27251
# Group Title: GEN000140-3
# Rule ID: SV-34550r1_rule
# Severity: medium
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN000140-3
# Rule Title: A file integrity baseline including cryptographic hashes 
# must be maintained.


#
# Vulnerability Discussion: A file integrity baseline is a collection of 
# file metadata which is to evaluate the integrity of the system. A minimal 
# baseline must contain metadata for all device files, setuid files, setgid 
# files, system libraries, system binaries, and system configuration files. 
# The minimal metadata must consist of the mode, owner, group owner, and 
# modification times. For regular files, metadata must also include file 
# size and a cryptographic hash of the fileâ€™s contents.


#
# Responsibility: System Administrator
# IAControls: DCSW-1
#
# Check Content:
#
# Verify a system integrity baseline is maintained. The baseline has been 
# updated to be consistent with the latest approved system configuration 
# changes. The Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is included 
# in the distribution of RHEL-5. Other host intrusion detection system 
# (HIDS) software is available but must be checked manually.

# Procedure:
# grep DBDIR /etc/aide.conf

# If /etc/aide.conf does not exist AIDE has not been installed. Unless 
# another HIDS is used on the system, this is a finding.

# Examine the response for "database" indicates the location of the system 
# integrity baseline database used as input to a comparison. 
# ls -la <DBDIR>

# If the no "database" file as defined in /etc/aide.conf a system integrity 
# baseline has not been created, this is a finding.

# Ask the SA when the last approved system configuration changes occurred. 
# If the modification date of the AIDE database is prior to the last 
# approved configuration change, this is a finding.


#
# Fix Text: 
#
# Regularly rebuild the integrity baseline, including cryptographic 
# hashes, for the system to be consistent with the latest approved system 
# configuration.

# Procedure:
# After an approved modification to the system configuration has been made 
# perform:

# aide -u
# This will update the database.
