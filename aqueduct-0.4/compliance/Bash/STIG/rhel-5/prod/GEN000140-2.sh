# Group ID (Vulid): V-27250
# Group Title: GEN000140-2
# Rule ID: SV-34549r1_rule
# Severity: medium
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): GEN000140-2
# Rule Title: A file integrity baseline including cryptographic hashes 
# must be created.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: A file integrity baseline is a collection of 
# file metadata which is to evaluate the integrity of the system. A minimal 
# baseline must contain metadata for all device files, setuid files, setgid 
# files, system libraries, system binaries, and system configuration files. 
# The minimal metadata must consist of the mode, owner, group owner, and 
# modification times. For regular files, metadata must also include file 
# size and a cryptographic hash of the fileâ€™s contents.


#
# Responsibility: System Administrator
# IAControls: DCSW-1
#
# Check Content:
#
# Verify a system integrity baseline exists. The Advanced Intrusion 
# Detection Environment (AIDE) is included in the distribution of RHEL. 
# Other host intrusion detection system (HIDS) software is available but 
# must be checked manually.

# Procedure:
# grep DBDIR /etc/aide.conf

# If /etc/aide.conf does not exist AIDE has not been installed. Unless 
# another HIDS is used on the system, this is a finding.

# Examine the response for "database" this indicates the location of the 
# system integrity baseline database used as input to a comparison. 
# ls -la <DBDIR>

# If no "database" file as defined in /etc/aide.conf exists a system 
# integrity baseline has not been created, this is a finding.

# Examine /etc/aide.conf to ensure some form of cryptographic hash (i.e. 
# md5,rmd168,sha256) is used for files. In the default /etc/aide.conf the 
# "NORMAL" or "LSPP" rules which are used for virtually all files DO 
# include some form of cryptographic hash.

# If the site has defined rules to replace the functionality provided by 
# the default "NORMAL" and "LSPP" rules but DOES NOT include cryptographic 
# hashes, this is a finding.

# Otherwise, if any element used to define the "NORMAL" and "LSPP" rules 
# has been modified resulting in cryptographic hashes not being used, this 
# is a finding.

# If any other modification to the default /etc/aide.conf file have been 
# made resulting in rules which do not include cryptographic hashes on 
# appropriate files, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: 
#
# Use AIDE to create a file integrity baseline, including cryptographic 
# hashes, for the system.

# Configure the /etc/aide.conf file to ensure some form of cryptographic 
# hash (ie. md5,rmd168,sha256) is used for files. In the default 
# /etc/aide.conf the "NORMAL" or "LSPP" rules which are used for virtually 
# all files DO include some form of cryptographic hash.
