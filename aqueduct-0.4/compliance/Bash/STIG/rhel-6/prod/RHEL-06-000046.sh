# Rule ID: RHEL-06-000046_rule
# Severity: medium
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): RHEL-06-000046
# Rule Title: Library files must be owned by root.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: Files from shared library directories are 
# loaded into the address space of processes (including privileged ones) or 
# of the kernel itself at runtime. Proper ownership is necessary to protect 
# the integrity of the system.
#
# Responsibility: 
# IAControls: 
#
# Check Content:
#
# System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables 
# during process load time or run time, are stored in the following 
# directories by default: 

# /lib
# /lib64
# /usr/lib
# /usr/lib64


# Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are 
# stored in "/lib/modules". All files in these directories should not be 
# group-writable or world-writable.  To find shared libraries that are not 
# owned by "root", run the following command for each directory [DIR] which 
# contains shared libraries: 

# $ find -L [DIR] \! -user root


# If any of these files are not owned by root, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text:

# during process load time or run time, are stored in the following 
# directories by default: 

# /lib
# /lib64
# /usr/lib
# /usr/lib64

# If any file in these directories is found to be owned by a user other 
# than root, correct its ownership with the following command: 

# chown root [FILE]
