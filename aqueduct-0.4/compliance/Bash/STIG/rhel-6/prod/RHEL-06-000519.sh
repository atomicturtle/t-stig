# Rule ID: RHEL-06-000519_rule
# Severity: low
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): RHEL-06-000519
# Rule Title: The system package management tool must verify contents of 
# all files associated with packages.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: The hash on important files like system 
# executables should match the information given by the RPM database. 
# Executables with erroneous hashes could be a sign of nefarious activity 
# on the system.
#
# Responsibility: 
# IAControls: 
#
# Check Content:
#
# The following command will list which files on the system have file 
# hashes different from what is expected by the RPM database. 

# rpm -Va | grep '$1 ~ /..5/ && $2 != "c"'


# If there is output, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: 
#
# The RPM package management system can check the hashes of installed 
# software packages, including many that are important to system security. 
# Run the following command to list which files on the system have hashes 
# that differ from what is expected by the RPM database: 

# rpm -Va | grep '^..5'

# A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, 
# which may appropriately be expected to change. If the file that has 
# changed was not expected to then refresh from distribution media or 
# online repositories. 

# rpm -Uvh [affected_package]

# OR 

# yum reinstall [affected_package]

#This could get ugly, so were gonna assume that the system is bound to some sort of REPO
#that can reinstall packages should they fall out of sync with the RPMDB.
