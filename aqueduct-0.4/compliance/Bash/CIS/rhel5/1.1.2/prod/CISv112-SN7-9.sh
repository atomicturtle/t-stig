#7.9 Disable USB Devices
#Description:
#USB drives and memory devices represent another attack vector against 
#a system. The prices for a 1GB USB memory device, or larger, have become 
#very affordable, and is enough storage to transport vast quantities of 
#data off a system. Few servers have need for USB devices and this whole 
#avenue should be disabled.


#MOved this to CISv112-SN4 since it was executing AFTER the chatter +i
#Which blocked it...
