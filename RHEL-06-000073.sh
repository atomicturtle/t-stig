# Rule ID: RHEL-06-000073_rule
# Severity: medium
# Rule Version (STIG-ID): RHEL-06-000073
# Rule Title: The Department of Defense (DoD) login banner must be 
# displayed immediately prior to, or as part of, console login prompts.
#
# Vulnerability Discussion: An appropriate warning message reinforces 
# policy awareness during the logon process and facilitates possible legal 
# action against attackers.
#
# Responsibility: 
# IAControls: 
#
# Check Content:
#
# To check if the system login banner is compliant, run the following 
# command: 

# $ cat /etc/issue


# If it does not display the required banner, this is a finding.
#
# Fix Text: 
#
# To configure the system login banner: 

# Edit "/etc/issue". Replace the default text with a message compliant with 
# the local site policy or a legal disclaimer. The DoD required text is 
# either: 

# "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that 
# is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes 
# any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions: 
# -The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for 
# purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC 
# monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), 
# law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations. 
# -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS. 
# -Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are 
# subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be 
# disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose. 
# -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access 
# controls) to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or 
# privacy. 
# -Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to 
# PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of 
# privileged communications, or work product, related to personal 
# representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and
